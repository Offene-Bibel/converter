Offene Bibel OSIS Exporter
--------------------------

To build the project:
-install maven from http://maven.apache.org/download.html
-run build.sh
--> the results reside in the install/ folder

If you're on Windows, then please convert build.sh to a batch script and send it to me. :-)


To run the converter call:
install/bin/export.sh/bat
This will download the translation from the Offene Bibel and create two .osis files in the install/results/ folder.
The exporter caches all files it downloads to install/tmp/pageCache/. They won't be redownloaded. To redownload a file, just delete it in the cache.


There is also a convenience script that creates two sword modules copies them to ~/.sword and creates a .zip archive in install/bin/swordConverter.sh


And then there is the validator that checks a given Wiki page for validity.
You can run it as follows:
install/bin/validator.sh path/to/a/wikiPage
