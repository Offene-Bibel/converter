--------------------------

To build the project:
-install a Java 7
	-sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk
	-yum install java-1.7.0-openjdk
	-or manually
		-download and unzip/install from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html
		-export JAVA_HOME=/wherever/you/unzipped/jdk1.7.0_17/
-install maven
	-sudo apt-get install maven2
	-yum install maven2
	-or manually from http://maven.apache.org/download.html
-run build.sh
--> the results reside in the install/ folder


To run the converter call:
install/bin/export.sh --help

The converter will download the translation from the Offene Bibel and create two .osis files in the install/results/ folder.
The exporter caches all files it downloads to install/tmp/pageCache/. They won't be redownloaded. To redownload a file, just delete it in the cache.


There is also a convenience script that creates two sword modules copies them to ~/.sword and creates a .zip archive in install/bin/swordConverter.sh


And then there is the validator that checks a given Wiki page for validity.
You can run it as follows:
install/bin/validator.sh path/to/a/wikiPage
